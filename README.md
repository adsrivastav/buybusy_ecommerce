Create a dynamic e-commerce web application that allows users to browse, shop, and manage their orders. This project integrates various key features and technologies to provide a seamless shopping experience.

Project Features:

1. Firebase Authentication for Sign In and Sign Up:

Implement Firebase Authentication to allow users to register, sign in, and manage their accounts securely.
2. Firebase Database for Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD):

Utilize Firebase Realtime Database to store and manage product data. Implement CRUD operations to add, view, update, and delete products.


3. Using React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext):

Employ React's useState to manage component state and user input.
Utilize useEffect to handle component lifecycle events, such as data fetching and side effects.
Implement useContext for managing global state and sharing data between components.


4. useEffect Hook for Component Mount:

Utilize the useEffect hook for actions that should occur when components mount, like fetching initial data.


5. React Routing for Multi-Page Navigation:

Set up a navigation system using React Router to create distinct pages for the home, cart, and my orders.


6. Display Toast Notifications for Product Actions:

Implement toast notifications to provide feedback to users when they add or delete products from their cart.
7. Implement Page Loading Spinner:

Create a loading spinner component that is shown while fetching data, enhancing user experience.


8. Manage State with Context API and useContext Hook:

Implement a global state management system using Context API. Utilize the useContext hook to consume and update this shared state throughout the app.


9. Additional Task - Product Filtering and Search:

Enhance the user experience by adding product filtering options and a search feature to make it easier for users to find products they are interested in.

**Project Structure:**

***Authentication: Sign In, Sign Up, Sign Out***
Product Management: CRUD operations, product filtering
Global State Management: Context API for shared data
React Router: Navigation between Home, Cart, and My Orders pages
Toast Notifications: Display feedback for product actions
Loading Spinner: Provide visual feedback during data loading
Firebase Integration: Realtime Database for product data and authentication
This project will combine these elements to create a full-fledged e-commerce web application, complete with user authentication, product management, and a smooth user interface. You can expand upon these features and design the application according to your specific requirements and preferences.
